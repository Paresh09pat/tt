<h3>Q2- What is Routing in nodeJS? </h3>
Ans-- A Javascript router is a key component in most frontend frameworks. -It is the piece of software in charge to organize the states of the application, switching between different views. -Routing defines the way in which the client requests are handled by the application endpoints. -And when you make some routers in separate file, you can use them by using middleware.

<h3>Q3- What is middleware?</h3>
Ans-- A middleware is a function which is used for handling requests.it takes three arguments,i.e,request,response,next.Basically,at first,the client request will go to the middleware,not directly to the server.if the condition specified in the middleware is fulfilled,then only middleware will send the request to server using next(),otherwise the request will be redirected.there are two types of middleware,global middleware and local middleware.

<h3>Q4- What is express?</h3>
Ans-- Express is back-end web application framework of nodejs that provides us with broad features for building web and mobile applications.It is faster,unopinionated and minimalistic.

<h3>Q5- What is module? </h3>
Ans-- A module is similar to a js library.it has set of functions or reusable code writen over there that we can use in our application.we import a module in nodejs by using the require() method.
